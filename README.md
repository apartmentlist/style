# Coding In Style

We all recognize that style matters, and particularly that having _a_ consistent
style matters more than _my_ or _your_ particular preference for a style (See
Sandi Metz's _Looks Matter_). This repository contains the Apartment List style.

# Changing Style

Thrash is anathema to consistency, so we are making it very difficult to change
styles. Consider it a Constitution. We all agreed on it hundreds of years ago,
and though everyone has some gripes with it, it's pretty good and we're leaving
it alone.

Since we're intentionally making it difficult to change, I'm only going to give
you one criterion to consider when you want to propose a change:

1. The style is probably not going to change, and that's ok!
